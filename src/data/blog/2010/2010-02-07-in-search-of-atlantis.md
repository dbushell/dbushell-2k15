Every get that feeling you're out of the loop? People know something you don't?

I've been in London for closer to 2 years now, so it was starting to get slightly embarrassing that the nearest arts superstore I could recommend was over 200 miles away. Thankfully I'd heard rumours that the east-end housed my answer (evidence below).

They also sell paint, pencil, paper, EVERYTHING you need. Well actually I needed Origami paper and I had to trek another 2 miles to find that. But [this place](http://www.atlantisart.co.uk) is still awesome. Take note of the subtle notice informing their change of location. Because Google Maps hasn't _*shakes fist*_.
