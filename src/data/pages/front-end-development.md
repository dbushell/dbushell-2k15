Static design mock-ups may look pretty, but you can't experience true performance in Photoshop. I prefer to work in iterations of design, prototype, test and review — allowing final decisions to be made in the browser.

Through coding I can deliver:

* An entire website ...
* ... or just a little bit of maintenance?
* Templates for many frameworks
* Pattern and component libraries
* Build and deployment workflows
* Front-end performance reviews
* Progressive Web Apps

Web standards are ever-evolving. I see each project as an opportunity to refresh my methods and hone my practice. I understand the quirks of old browsers and the benefits of new technology. I use progressive enhancement to deliver accessible websites based on an intrinsic knowledge of the front-end.

**Favourite tools and technologies:**

<ul class="b-boxed b-boxed--spec">
  <li>HTML / CSS</li>
  <li>Sass</li>
  <li>SVG</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Vue.js</li>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Git</li>
  <li>Gulp</li>
  <li>WordPress</li>
  <li>Gutenberg</li>
  <li>Shopify</li>
  <li>Netlify</li>
  <li>Cloudflare</li>
  <li>Service Workers</li>
</ul>

I'm not fussy. I can work with high-fidelity design software or back-of-the-napkin sketches. My background in design gives me an intuitive understanding to interpret, iterate upon, and best utilise visual concepts.
