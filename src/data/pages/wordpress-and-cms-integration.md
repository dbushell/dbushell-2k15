How useful is a website if it cannot be updated? Without a content management system that's difficult. I work with a wide variety of set-ups.

I have extensive knowledge of WordPress & Gutenberg development. I’m also proficient in many HTML and JavaScript template languages as well as alternative serverless solutions.

WordPress is often the go-to platform because of its undeniable legacy. I've been writing themes and plugins since practically the beginning. The new Gutenberg editor combined with the right [front-end development](/front-end-development/) skillset provides a powerfully modern CMS experience.

Tempted to utilise something truly cutting-edge? I'll happily embrace the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) lifestyle with modern build and deployment systems.

While I'm not a back-end programmer, for the right project I can deliver an all-in-one solution (or otherwise, work with a team to do so).
