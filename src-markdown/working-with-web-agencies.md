### Building for browsers

**I'm not** IE-phobic! I understand the quirks of old browsers and use progressive enhancement to deliver accessible pages appropriate to each browser's capabilities. Universal "pixel perfection" is a detrimental idea, I get the details right where they matter.

### Professional experience

Prior to my freelancing life, immediately after graduation, I worked in London's trendy East End for five years with two digital agencies. I quickly moved into a senior client-facing role being responsible for all front-end code and design on many projects.

During this time I worked with just about every client imaginable from the public sector departments to the small local businesses. I found that a personable and attentive approach to discussing a client's business instilled trust. Rather than trying to "sell" a website design I'd involve clients in the process as if they were designing it alongside me.

I went freelance early 2013 and kicked things off by speaking at the [Responsive Day Out](http://dbushell.com/2012/12/07/responsive-day-out/) conference in Brighton. Since then I provided my front-end skills to many web agencies, including my former employers.
