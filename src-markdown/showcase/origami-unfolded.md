Origami Unfolded won me membership into the ISTD (International Society of Typographic Designers) and was featured in the Computer Arts magazine Graduate Showcase 2008.

The collection brief stated “This challenge is to design a catalogue for your collection. Consider this as an information system and apply the necessary logical clarity to inform as well as enthuse and delight the reader”. I'm very thankful to Ronald Koh for his permission to reproduce the Eagle folding diagrams, and to friend and photographer Kate Boswell.
