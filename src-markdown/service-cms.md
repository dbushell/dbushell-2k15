Let's face it, what use is a website if you can't update it? I'm a huge fan of short and [frequent projects](/process-and-strategy/). Without a content management system that can be difficult.

I have extensive knowledge in PHP and particularly WordPress theme development. I'm also very proficient in other HTML template languages.

While I'm not a back-end programmer,Â I'm happy to deliver an all-in-one solution or work with other agencies to develop a website. [Let's talk requirements](/contact/).
