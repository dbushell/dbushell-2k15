Ever since I started the daily photo project I've been looking to buy a digital camera. The iPhone's camera has been surprisingly good but it doesn't hold up to serious goat photography (scroll down).

My choice came down to a toss up between the Olympus E-P1 (above) and the Panasonic Lumix GF1. Both use the new [Micro Four Thirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system) system which means a large sensor and interchangeable lenses, but without the bulk of a digital SLR. The trade off is no mirror and therefore no optical viewfinder. This is replaced by a 3" LCD screen on the back.

I chose the E-P1 over the other option(s) mainly because it looks retro and totally bad-ass (didn't say I actually knew anything about cameras). From a weekend of testing I'm very pleased with the results. The E-P1 is a perfect camera for the weekend tourist/hobbyist photographer and weekday graphic designer, like me! My new friends agree:
