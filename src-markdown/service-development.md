Static design mock-ups may look pretty, but you can't experience interaction or performance in Photoshop. I work in iterations of design, prototype, test and review — no decisions are made away from the browser.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web standards evolve daily. I take every project as an opportunity to refresh my methods and hone my practice. [My blog](/blog/) updates weekly and I write [coding articles](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/author/david-bushell/) for industry leader Smashing Magazine. I host several popular [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell).

**Favourite tools and technologies:**

<ul class="speclist">

  <li>Sass</li>
  <li>SVG</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>

  <li>Node</li>

An intrinsic knowledge of front-end development is a cornerstone of usable website design.
