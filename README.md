> Build process and source for [dbushell.com](http://dbushell.com/)

## What’s in here?

Quite a lot!

## What does it do?

It builds my website by:

* compiling Markdown and Handlebars templates using [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) to generate a static site
* processing assets — SVG, CSS, JavaScript etc — using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Can I build it?

You can try, probably won’t work! The build process is configured for my server configurations and there are outside dependencies.

You may find the Grunt and Metalsmith tasks useful. Feel free to copy / adapt them for your own use.

Everything in directories prefixed `src-` is mine!
